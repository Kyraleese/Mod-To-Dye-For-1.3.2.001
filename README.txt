Mod-To-Dye-For-1.3.001
=====================

Mod To Dye For for Minecraft 1.3.2, Forge compatible.

Add a little color to your minecraft worlds!  Adds glass, cobblestone, stone and wooden planks.

It should go without saying:  I am not responsible for any damage done to your minecraft installs, including the game itself or any save files.  Back your stuff up, always!

I plan to have a lot more colorable items in the future; for the moment treat this as an early beta (I haven't even gotten a config file together yet and am using 500-510 for block ids).

Known bug:  When dyed sand falls, its damage gets set to that of black.  So if you want your sand to stay colored, for the time being make sure it doesn't fall.

Just pop the zip file in your mods folder after installing Forge and you should be ready to go!
