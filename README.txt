Mod-To-Dye-For-1.3.001
=====================

Mod To Dye For for Minecraft 1.3.2, Forge compatible.

Add a little color to your minecraft worlds!  Adds glass, cobblestone, stone and wooden planks.

It should go without saying:  I am not responsible for any damage done to your minecraft installs, including the game itself or any save files.  Back your stuff up, always!

I plan to have a lot more colorable items in the future; for the moment treat this as an early beta (I haven't even gotten a config file together yet and am using 500-507 for block ids).

Just pop the zip file in your mods folder after installing Forge and you should be ready to go!
