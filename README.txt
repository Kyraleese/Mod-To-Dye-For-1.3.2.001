Mod-To-Dye-For-1.3.001
=====================

Mod To Dye For for Minecraft 1.3.2, Forge compatible.

Add a little color to your minecraft worlds!  Adds glass, cobblestone, stone and wooden planks.

It should go without saying:  I am not responsible for any damage done to your minecraft installs, including the game itself or any save files.  Back your stuff up, always!

I plan to have a lot more colorable items in the future; for the moment treat this as an early beta (I haven't even gotten a config file together yet and am using 500-503 for block ids).

For the time being, just zip this all up and drop the zip in the mods folder and you should be good to go.
